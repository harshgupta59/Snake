# Snake
DESCRIPTION-
The “snake game” is a game made in C++ language. This is a game which is quite
easy to play. The game is a classic representation of the snake game which appears
as an inbuilt game feature in most of the leading mobile handsets like Nokia.

Your goal is to move the snake and eat as many “food” blocks as possible. Your
score increases by 10 for eating a single food. There is only one food block at any
given time. When the food is eaten, the snake grows in length. If you hit the snake
itself the game is over.

Depending on the mode selection, the game modifies itself and hence gives the user
choices as he is free to select the difficulty level.

1)EASY (unbounded) - Here, during the process of travelling, if the snake hits the
boundary wall, it does not die, instead it comes out from the opposite wall as though
there is a continuation in the movement.

2)HARD (bounded) - Here, during the process of travelling, if the snake hits the
boundary wall, the snake dies, and this is counted as a loss of life and the game ends.
This is a tougher mode as compared to the unbounded mode.
Use following keys to play snake gamekey ‘a’ to move left.
key ‘w’ to move up.
key ‘d’ to move right.
key ‘s’ to move down.
If the user wishes to quit the game anytime, you can press the ‘X’ key on the
keyboard. This would directly exit the game.
